Document Title: Social Network All Posts Page Template
Author: Moise Botsoe
Date: 22.04.2024

Description:
This HTML template represents a page displaying all posts in a social network application. 
It extends a layout template named "layout.html" and includes a loop to iterate over 
each post in the provided context variable 'posts'. For each post, it displays the author's 
username, content, timestamp, and a placeholder for the number of likes (which can be 
implemented later). Each post is separated by a horizontal line.

Dependencies:
- 'layout.html' template (Ensure 'layout.html' is correctly defined and includes necessary CSS and JavaScript imports.)

Usage:
1. Ensure the 'layout.html' template is correctly defined and includes necessary CSS and JavaScript imports.
2. Pass the 'posts' variable containing a list of post objects from the backend to this template when rendering the page.
3. Customize the post display by modifying the HTML structure and CSS styles as needed.
4. Implement functionality to retrieve and display the number of likes for each post. You can do this by updating the placeholder "Likes: 0" dynamically using JavaScript or by rendering the actual like count from the backend.
